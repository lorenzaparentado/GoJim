        <h2>Pushups</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/gI-8qCUEko8AAAAM/pushup.gif">
        <p>Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet together.

Keep your hands directly under your shoulders and your fingers spread apart.

Keep your body in a straight line from your head to your heels, with your core engaged and your glutes squeezed.

Lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.

Keep your neck in a neutral position, with your eyes focused on the ground.

Continue lowering your body until your chest touches the ground, or until your arms are at a 90-degree angle.

Push back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid arching your back or sagging your hips.

Breathe in as you lower your body, and exhale as you push back up.

Start with a modified pushup on your knees if a full pushup is too challenging.

  <p>Lie on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground and your back, head, and butt in contact with the bench.

Grasp the barbell with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your palms facing away from your body.

Lift the bar off the rack and hold it directly over your chest with your arms extended.

Lower the bar towards your chest by bending your elbows, keeping them pointed out to the sides.

Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body to emphasize the chest muscles.

Stop when the bar is about an inch above your chest.

Push the bar back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid arching your back or lifting your butt off the bench.

Adjust the cable machine: Adjust the cable machine to the appropriate height for your exercise. Choose a weight that is challenging but allows you to maintain proper form.

Stand facing the cable machine: Stand facing the cable machine with one foot slightly in front of the other for stability.

Hold the handles: Grab the cable handles with both hands, palms facing down.

Engage your core: Tighten your abdominal muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine.

Position your arms: Extend your arms out to your sides, with your elbows slightly bent and your hands at shoulder height.

Bring your hands together: Slowly bring your hands together in front of your chest, keeping your elbows slightly bent and your core engaged the entire time.

Pause at the top: Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly return your hands to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled: Perform the exercise in a slow and controlled manner, avoiding any jerky or sudden movements.

Keep your shoulders down: Keep your shoulders down and avoid shrugging them up towards your ears.

Breathe: Inhale as you bring your hands together, and exhale as you return your hands to the starting position.

        <p>Adjust the bench to a 30-45 degree incline and lie down with your feet flat on the ground and your back, head, and butt in contact with the bench.

Grasp the dumbbells with an overhand grip, with your palms facing forward and your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

Lift the dumbbells off the ground and hold them directly over your chest with your arms extended.

Lower the dumbbells towards your chest by bending your elbows, keeping them pointed out to the sides.

Stop when the dumbbells are about an inch above your chest.

Push the dumbbells back up to the starting position by straightening your arms.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid arching your back or lifting your butt off the bench.

Use a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with good form and without straining.

        <p>Adjust the seat height so that the handles are at chest level when you're seated.

Sit on the seat with your back flat against the pad and your feet flat on the ground.

Grasp the handles with your palms facing each other and your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle.

Squeeze your chest muscles and push the handles together until they meet in front of your chest.

Hold the contraction for a moment and then slowly release the handles back to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid jerking or swinging the handles.

Breathe out as you push the handles together, and breathe in as you release them back to the starting position.

Use a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with good form and without straining.

As you progress, gradually increase the weight and/or the number of repetitions.
