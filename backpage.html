        <h2>Lat Pulldown</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/yEnvkPC3jDoAAAAC/pulldown-exercise-dwayne-johnson.gif">
        <p>Grip the bar with your palms facing away from you (overhand grip), wider than shoulder-width apart.

Sit down on the bench and adjust the knee pad so that it fits snugly against your thighs. This will prevent you from lifting off the bench and using momentum to complete the exercise.

Start with your arms extended fully overhead, and your back straight. Your feet should be flat on the floor.

Pull the bar down towards your chest in a slow and controlled manner, keeping your elbows close to your sides.

Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

Slowly release the bar back to the starting position, extending your arms fully overhead.

Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise, and avoid swinging your body or using momentum to complete the movement.

Breathe in as you pull the bar down, and exhale as you release it back to the starting position.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using a lighter weight or adjusting the cable attachment height to find a more comfortable position.

Finally, make sure to stretch your lats and other upper body muscles after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.

        <h2>Back Extension</h2>

  <p>Start by lying face down on a back extension bench, with your feet securely anchored under the footpads and your hands resting behind your head.

Engage your glutes and lower back muscles, and lift your upper body off the bench as high as you can, keeping your head and neck in a neutral position.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then lower your body back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.

Repeat the exercise for the desired number of reps, making sure to keep your movements slow and deliberate.

Avoid arching your back too much or hyperextending your spine, as this can lead to injury.

Focus on squeezing your glutes and lower back muscles throughout the movement, rather than relying on momentum or swinging your body.

You can also vary the exercise by holding a weight plate or dumbbell against your chest, or by adding a twist at the top of the movement to engage your obliques.

If you're a beginner or new to the exercise, start with a lighter weight or bodyweight only until you develop the proper form and strength to perform the exercise safely.

Finally, make sure to stretch your lower back muscles and hamstrings after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>

        <h2>Single-Arm Dumbbell Row</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/_XCUlWAGsWIAAAAd/dumbbell-row-heavy.gif">
        <p>Start by selecting a dumbbell of appropriate weight and placing it on the floor next to a bench or other sturdy surface.

Place your left hand and left knee on the bench, and keep your right foot flat on the floor. Your back should be straight and parallel to the floor.

Reach down with your right hand and pick up the dumbbell, keeping your palm facing your body.

Pull the dumbbell up towards your chest, keeping your elbow close to your side and squeezing your shoulder blades together.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then lower the dumbbell back down to the starting position in a controlled manner.

Repeat the exercise for the desired number of reps, then switch sides and repeat with your left arm.

Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise, and avoid rotating your torso or lifting your hips.

Breathe in as you pull the weight up, and exhale as you lower it back down.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using a lighter weight or adjusting your position on the bench to find a more comfortable angle.

Finally, make sure to stretch your back muscles and shoulders after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>

        <h2>Pull-Ups</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/G-a7AMKpQugAAAAd/pull-ups-nigel-sylvester.gif">
        <p>Start by gripping the pull-up bar with your palms facing away from you (overhand grip), and your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended, and your feet crossed behind you.

Engage your core and shoulder blades, and pull your body up towards the bar in a slow and controlled manner, keeping your elbows close to your sides.

Aim to pull your chest towards the bar, rather than just your chin.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

Keep your movements slow and deliberate, and avoid swinging or using momentum to complete the exercise.

Breathe in as you pull yourself up, and exhale as you lower yourself back down.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using an assisted pull-up machine or resistance bands to provide additional support.

As you get stronger, you can also try performing variations of the exercise, such as close-grip pull-ups or chin-ups.

Finally, make sure to stretch your back, shoulders, and arms after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>
