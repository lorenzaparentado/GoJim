        <p>Begin by sitting on the floor with your back against a bench or platform. Your knees should be bent, with your feet flat on the ground and your heels close to your buttocks.

Place a barbell across your hips, and hold it in place with both hands.

Engage your glutes and core, and press your feet into the ground to lift your hips off the floor.

Push your hips up towards the ceiling until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees.

Hold for a second, then lower your hips back down to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid arching your back or letting your knees flare out.</p>

        <p>Start with a warm-up: Before starting any exercise, it's important to warm up your muscles to prevent injury. Perform some light cardio or dynamic stretches to get your blood flowing and your muscles loosened up.

Adjust the equipment: Make sure the hyperextension bench is adjusted to fit your body size. The top of the bench should be at hip height, and the footpads should be adjusted to fit your feet snugly.

Position yourself correctly: Lie face down on the hyperextension bench with your feet secured under the footpads. Place your hands behind your head or cross them over your chest.

Engage your core: Tighten your abs and glutes to help stabilize your spine and prevent excessive arching or hyperextension.

Lift slowly: Lift your torso up until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your hips. Avoid lifting too quickly or using momentum to lift yourself up.

Lower slowly: Lower your torso back down to the starting position slowly and with control. Avoid dropping your torso or letting it sag down.</p>
