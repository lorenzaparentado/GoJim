        <img class="image" src="https://149874912.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Front-squat.gif">
        <p>Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and the barbell resting on the front of your shoulders, with your palms facing up and your elbows pointed forward.

Keeping your core engaged and your chest up, slowly lower your body by bending your knees and hips, pushing your butt back and down.

Keep your back straight and your knees in line with your toes as you lower yourself down until your thighs are parallel to the ground.

Pause for a moment at the bottom of the squat and then push through your heels to stand back up to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid arching your back or leaning forward excessively.

Breathe in as you lower your body, and exhale as you push back up to the starting position.

Use a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with good form and without straining.

As you progress, gradually increase the weight and/or the number of repetitions.

Finally, make sure to stretch your legs and hips after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>
