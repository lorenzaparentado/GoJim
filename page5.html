    <p>Incorporate stretching into your daily routine, focusing on the muscle groups that feel tight. Hold each stretch for 15-30 seconds and repeat it 2-3 times. Before you stretch, warm up your body with light aerobic exercises, such as walking or jogging, for 5-10 minutes. This will increase blood flow to your muscles and reduce the risk of injury. Foam rolling is a self-massage technique that can help relieve muscle tension and improve flexibility. Roll the foam roller over the muscle group, applying moderate pressure for 30-60 seconds. Drinking enough water can help keep your muscles hydrated and supple, which can improve flexibility. When you're stretching, gradually increase the intensity of the stretch over time. Don't force your muscles beyond their limits, as this can lead to injury.</p>
