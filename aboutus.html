    <h1>About GoJim!</h1>
    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>2023 just started. What a great time to start working out, but how do you start? Personal trainers and fitness apps are all paywalled and complicated. We would like to introduce GoJim!, a free fitness-tracking website with an abundance of workout plans and diet suggestions for any level. It can track your weight loss, calories, and progress. Unlike other applications, we implemented a chat function for users to communicate with other gymgoers at no cost! A personal trainer, dietician, and workout partner at your fingertips! Start the new year off right! GoJim!</p>
    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>Our mission is to provide affordable access to fitness-tracking instruments and dietary suggestions for all gymgoers, regardless of their expertise, in hopes to encourage the development of a healthier lifestyle. We strongly support that we have only one body, therefore, we should not compromise and take advantage of the available resources to understand the value of our physical health. Our software is designed to meet all of the preferences of the customer. Through customer responses and feedback, we hope to improve our software and further advance fitness-related technologies.</p>
