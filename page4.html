    <p>Once you know your daily caloric needs, set a realistic goal for how many calories you want to consume each day. A safe and sustainable rate of weight gain is about 0.5-1 pound per week, which requires a daily surplus of 250-500 calories.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>When you're on a calorie surplus diet, it's important to choose foods that are high in nutrients and calories. Focus on lean protein sources, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks, which are high in calories but low in nutrients. To make sure you're sticking to your calorie surplus, track your food intake using a food diary or a mobile app. This will help you see where you're consuming enough calories and where you need to make adjustments. Exercise can help you build muscle and support weight gain. Set short-term goals, celebrate your successes, and find a support system to help you stay on track.</p>
