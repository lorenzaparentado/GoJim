    <p> If you're new to strength training, start with bodyweight exercises, such as squats, lunges, and calf raises, to build a foundation of strength. Compound exercises, such as squats and deadlifts, work multiple muscle groups at once, helping you build overall strength and power. As you get stronger, incorporate weight training into your routine. Use dumbbells, barbells, or resistance bands to challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.When strength training, it's important to use proper form to prevent injuries and maximize results. Focus on good posture, engage your core muscles, and use a full range of motion. Give your muscles time to rest and recover between workouts. Aim for 1-2 days of rest between lower body strength training sessions.</p>
