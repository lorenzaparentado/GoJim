        <h2>Skull Crushers</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/-Pq0I_p6kG0AAAAC/skulls.gif">
        <p>Lie down on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head positioned at the end of the bench.

Hold a barbell with an overhand grip, with your hands shoulder-width apart.

Extend your arms straight up over your chest, keeping your elbows locked in place.

Slowly lower the bar down towards your forehead by bending your elbows, making sure to keep your upper arms stationary.

Stop just before the bar touches your forehead, and then slowly lift the bar back up to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid swinging your arms or arching your back.

        <h2>Dips</h2>

  <p>Stand between two parallel bars and grip each bar with your hands, making sure your arms are fully extended and your feet are off the ground.

Lean forward slightly and lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your sides.

Lower yourself until your elbows form a 90-degree angle, or until your chest is level with the bars.

Pause for a moment at the bottom of the movement, and then push through your palms to straighten your arms and lift your body back up to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid swinging your body or arching your back.

If you have trouble with dips, you can start with assisted dips using a resistance band or machine, or by using a bench to support your legs. As you get stronger, you can gradually decrease the assistance until you can perform unassisted dips.</p>

        <p>Lie down on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground and your head positioned at the end of the bench.

Lift the barbell off the rack and hold it directly above your chest, with your arms fully extended.

Slowly lower the bar down towards your chest, making sure to keep your elbows close to your body.

Stop just before the bar touches your chest, and then push the bar back up to the starting position.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid bouncing the bar off your chest.

Keep your movements slow and controlled, and avoid swinging your arms or arching your back.
