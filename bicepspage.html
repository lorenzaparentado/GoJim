        <h2>Barbell Curl</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/aqgFkqTSq_kAAAAC/curl-workout.gif">
        <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and grip the barbell with your palms facing up (underhand grip) and your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

Hold the bar with your arms fully extended and your elbows close to your sides.

Engage your core and biceps, and slowly curl the bar up towards your chest in a controlled manner, keeping your elbows close to your sides.

Avoid swinging your body or using momentum to lift the weight.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

Keep your movements slow and deliberate, and avoid jerking or bouncing the weight.

Breathe in as you lift the weight, and exhale as you lower it back down.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using a lighter weight or adjusting your grip on the bar.

You can also try performing variations of the exercise, such as using dumbbells or cables.

Finally, make sure to stretch your biceps and forearms after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>

      </div>
  <p>Grip the pull-up bar with your palms facing towards you (underhand grip), and your hands shoulder-width apart.

Hang from the bar with your arms fully extended, and your feet crossed behind you.

Engage your core and biceps, and pull your body up towards the bar in a slow and controlled manner, keeping your elbows close to your sides.

Aim to pull your chin above the bar, rather than just your chest.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your body back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

Keep your movements slow and deliberate, and avoid swinging or using momentum to complete the exercise.

Breathe in as you pull yourself up, and exhale as you lower yourself back down.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using an assisted pull-up machine or resistance bands to provide additional support.

As you get stronger, you can also try performing variations of the exercise, such as wide-grip pull-ups or weighted chin-ups.

Finally, make sure to stretch your biceps, shoulders, and back after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>

        <h2>Hammer Curl</h2>
        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/XJZa937El1cAAAAd/7altarnate-hummer-curl.gif">
        <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body.

Hold the dumbbells with your arms fully extended at your sides, and keep your elbows close to your body.

Engage your core and biceps, and slowly curl the dumbbells up towards your chest in a controlled manner, keeping your elbows close to your sides.

Aim to keep your wrists straight throughout the movement, rather than curling them inwards or outwards.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

Keep your movements slow and deliberate, and avoid swinging or using momentum to lift the weight.

Breathe in as you lift the weight, and exhale as you lower it back down.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using a lighter weight or adjusting your grip on the dumbbells.

You can also try performing variations of the exercise, such as alternating hammer curls or using a barbell instead of dumbbells.

Finally, make sure to stretch your biceps and forearms after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>

        <img class="image" src="https://media.tenor.com/bsWJZ1Clix4AAAAd/bicep-bicep-curls.gif">
        <p>Stand facing a cable machine with a low pulley and attach a straight bar to the cable.

Grip the bar with your palms facing up (underhand grip) and your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.

Hold the bar with your arms fully extended and your elbows close to your sides.

Engage your core and biceps, and slowly curl the bar up towards your chest in a controlled manner, keeping your elbows close to your sides.

Avoid swinging your body or using momentum to lift the weight.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement, then slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position, fully extending your arms.

Keep your movements slow and deliberate, and avoid jerking or bouncing the weight.

Breathe in as you lift the weight, and exhale as you lower it back down.

If you're having trouble with the exercise, try using a lighter weight or adjusting the height of the cable machine.

You can also try performing variations of the exercise, such as using a rope attachment or performing single-arm cable curls.

Finally, make sure to stretch your biceps and forearms after your workout to prevent soreness and promote recovery.</p>
